## üîí Security & Privacy

### API Key Security
- Store your API key in `.env` file only
- Never commit `.env` to version control
- Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file
- Use different keys for development/production

### Data Privacy
- Your library data is sent to Google Gemini for analysis
- Review Google's [AI Studio Terms](https://ai.google.dev/terms)
- Consider data sensitivity when asking questions
- Gemini processes requests but doesn't store conversation history

## üö® Rate Limits & Costs

### Free Tier Limits
- **15 requests per minute**
- **1,500 requests per day**
- **32,000 characters per request**

### Cost Structure
- Free tier available for development and testing
- Paid plans available for production use

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "API key not set" Error
```bash
# Check your .env file exists in project root
ls -la .env

# Verify the content
cat .env
```
- Ensure file is named exactly `.env` (not `.env.txt`)
- Restart your development server after creating/modifying `.env`

#### "403 Forbidden" Error
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check API key permissions in Google AI Studio
- Ensure you're using a valid Gemini API key (not other Google APIs)

#### "429 Rate Limit" Error
- You've exceeded the free tier limits
- Wait for the rate limit to reset
- Consider upgrading to a paid plan for higher limits

#### Network Connection Errors
- Check your internet connection
- Verify firewall/proxy settings
- Try again after a few moments

### Development Tips

#### Testing API Configuration
The dashboard automatically detects API configuration status and shows:
- ‚úÖ Green indicator when properly configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow warning with setup instructions when missing/invalid

#### Monitoring Usage
API usage statistics are logged to console (in development):
```javascript
Gemini API Usage: {
  promptTokens: 1234,
  completionTokens: 567,
  totalTokens: 1801
}
```

#### Error Handling
The system provides user-friendly error messages:
- Configuration issues: "AI service configuration issue"
- Network problems: "Network connection issue"
- Rate limits: "Too many requests"
- Service issues: "AI service temporarily unavailable"

## üéØ Best Practices

### Question Formatting
- Be specific about what you want to analyze
- Reference specific communities, time periods, or benchmarks
- Ask for actionable recommendations

### Effective Prompts
```
‚úÖ Good: "What trends do you see in Chinese community engagement over the last 6 months?"
‚úÖ Good: "Which SLNSW benchmarks need immediate attention and why?"
‚ùå Avoid: "Tell me about the data"
‚ùå Avoid: "What should I do?"
```

### Data Filtering
- Set appropriate filters before asking questions
- AI responses are based on currently filtered data
- Use filters to focus analysis on specific communities or time periods
